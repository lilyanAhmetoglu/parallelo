# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Bind the active terminal to its git worktree; the Changes and Files views
  follow whichever terminal is focused.
- Resolve the worktree from the terminal's process tree, so agents that create
  their own worktree and chdir into it are tracked correctly.
- Name, colour and icon per session, persisted against the worktree.
- List every open terminal on activation, not only the focused one.

### Fixed
- Session name, colour and icon no longer disappear after a window reload. They
  were keyed on the git repository, which resolves asynchronously, so they were
  written under one key and read back under another.
